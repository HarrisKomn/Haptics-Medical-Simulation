# Medical-Simulation-Haptics
## Abstract
This research work aims to develop a virtual environment appropriate for
interactive (real-time) simulations of medical and surgical interventions.
These simulations have many applications including training of surgeons,
planning of interventions (for rehearsal and for the validation of a therapy)
or providing assistance during a real surgery. Nevertheless, in order to obtain an accurate and realistic simulation of a procedure, we have to simulate
with precision the deformation of anatomical structures and the interactions
between rigid medical devices and soft tissues. In addition, the simulation
must be interactive and computed in real-time to keep the gesture of the
physician in the loop of the simulation. The main goal of this research work
is to design a simulation which combines a high level of accuracy for the
deformations with low level of computation time.


First, we present the Co-rotational FEM method which is based on finite
element methods (FEM) and computes the biomechanics of anatomical soft
tissues. Second, we analyse the dynamic equations of the deformable bodies and we present the Lagrange multipliers approach which handles the
interactions in our virtual environment. Due to the fact that visual feedback
is not enough, physicians use haptic feedback for guidance. For this reason, we analyse the key concepts of the algorithms dedicated to real-time
haptic rendering. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of our implementation including a system of human organs such as: lungs, bronchus,
diaphragm and thorac, which the user can interact with, in real-time. Finally, we report the results derived from conducted experiments which prove
the validity of our application. We propose future work that will establish
medical simulation in the field of medicine.

## Virtual Environment

The virtual environment includes the human lungs with dark pink, diahragm with dark red, bronchus with white and thorac with transparent grey.
